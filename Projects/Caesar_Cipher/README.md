# Caesar Cipher
Caesar shift encryption

Replaces each letter in the message with the letter n positions away in the alphabet, where n remains constant. 
To increase the complexity of the cipher, the user can input a keyword as well as an n value. 
The letters in the keyword are placed at the beginning of the alphabet with repeated letters removed, followed by all unused letters in order. 
The n value is then used as in the normal alphabet.
