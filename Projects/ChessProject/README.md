# ChessProject
Through a text file (input.txt), the user will input a list of coordinates for their desired pieces.
Along with the pieces, they will also indicate the coordinate for piece "X".
The program will output all these pieces and display them on a chessboard in the output text file (output.txt).
Then it will then check which pieces can attack position "X" (in one move) and output those pieces to the output text file.
